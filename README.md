**The provided JavaScript code demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, **
including object creation, array manipulation, function definitions, and user input handling.
An object named person is created with properties such as firstname, lastname, and age, 
and its properties are accessed using both dot and bracket notation. An array,
selectedcolors, is initialized with two color strings and expanded by adding more elements, 
showcasing JavaScript's flexibility in handling mixed data types. 
The code includes a greet function that logs a greeting message based on the user's input and a sqaure function 
(with a typo, which should be square) that calculates the square of a number. User input is captured using the prompt() function,
allowing interaction with the user to display the result of the square calculation. Overall, 
this code serves as an effective educational tool for beginners learning JavaScript.
